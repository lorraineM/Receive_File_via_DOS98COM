# Send and Receive data via serial port COM

Task: implement sending and receiving data via serial port COM and do timekeeping for the whole procedure. The data is from the input file in.txt and we should output it to output file out.txt.

Implement: 
 Â * Initialize COM1 -- set its modem = 10H and Baud rate = 4800; 7 bits for data, 2 bits for stop, Odd Parity 
  * get input file
  * get destination file name and create it (output file)
  * when user press button the time-count start to work
  * implement this procedure back and forth until at end of the file: 
      * read 4K data from input file into read buffer -> send data via COM1 -> receive via COM1 -> write 4K data into write buffer
  * time-count stops
  * show the result

Environment: DOS98

File list:
  * file.asm assembly file
  * file.obj assembly object
  * file.exe exe file generated by link
